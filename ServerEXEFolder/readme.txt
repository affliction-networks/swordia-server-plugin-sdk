This is the folder where the server executable is located.


You need Semver.dll for the plugin system to work.

The plugin name should match the folder name in resources/plugins/ without the .dll extension.

Example if your dll is named MyPlugin.dll, then your folder should be named MyPlugin and contain the MyPlugin.dll file.

You do NOT need to copy any other files but your MyPlugin.dll into your plugin folder.
